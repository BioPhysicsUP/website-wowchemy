Climate change has caused extreme heat waves to increase in intensity and frequency. This
has a severe negative impact on crop yield and therefore food production. My project aims
to investigate the growth response of wheat to high temperature stress, using
hyperspectral imaging and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, as well as various
biological and chemical techniques. I aim to identify the physiological and quantum
mechanical mechanisms of the plantâ€™s response to heat stress, as well as plant adaptation
strategies to heat waves. This knowledge can be used to inform the development of
adaptive cultivation techniques to mitigate yield loss in high temperature conditions.
This project is an exciting look into the intersection between physics, biology and
chemistry and will investigate the effects of non-trivial physics in the context of a
complex biological system.
