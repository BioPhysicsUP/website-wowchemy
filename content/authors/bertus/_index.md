“My research focusses on extending the current single-molecule spectroscopy setup in order to perform single-particle tracking, allowing us to study 
freely diffusing photosynthetic proteins – in solution and eventually in a natural membrane. This is important as it brings us closer to performing 
single-molecule experiments in vivo. I am also interested in the theoretical side of single-particle tracking, as well as the use of photon correlations 
to study light harvesting. This includes picosecond correlations, like the quantum optical effect known as photon antibunching, as well as fluorescence 
correlation spectroscopy, which is used to study diffusion and dynamics such as protein aggregation.”
