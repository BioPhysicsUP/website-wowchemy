The most important goal for plants, even more important than the efficiency of
photosynthesis, is its survival. The biggest danger for plants lies in fluctuating
environments. Therefore, plants need to be able to photosynthesize in a wide range of
different environments. This is also integral for the efficiency of solar-powered energy.
My Masters project aims to further understand the intricasies of photosynthesis by
researching carotenoids, a pigment integral to photosynthesis and protection of the
organism, that we have previously been unable to research due to low fluorescence yield.
This will be done by intensifying the signal using plasmonic nanoparticles, which is also
currently a very exciting field of research. By deepening our understanding of
photosynthesis we are coming closer to developing bio-inspired technology to improve the
efficiency of solar-powered energyThe most important goal for plants, even more important
