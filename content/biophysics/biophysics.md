Biophysics is much more than biology + physics. It’s in fact the confluence of several scientific disciplines: 
physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, statistics, computer modelling, and engineering – all are integrated to solve some of nature’s big problems.

Personally, I like to put a stronger emphasis on physics (otherwise my physics colleagues tend to erroneously think I’m doing biology). 
This would be my definition: “Biophysics is the branch of physics that applies the methods and theories of physics to study biological systems. In short, biophysicists study the physics of living systems.”

But BPS prefers a [broader
definition](https://www.biophysics.org/what-is-biophysics).
